### Data Science and Python

Python is essential in data science for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization due to libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Pandas: Provides data structures for efficiently storing large datasets.
- NumPy: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python inspired by MATLAB.
